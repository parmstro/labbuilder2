# This playbook configures the mandatory configuration templates 
#
# NOTE: the files referenced in the sat_vars.yml file
# for mandatory configuration templates are located in the template directory
# of the foreman_post role. Optional configuration template files may be 
# placed in the same directory or a custom path may be provided.
# Also, if no variables are present, the file will simply
# be loaded to foreman/satellite as is
# 
# NOTE: If you are providing templates that will be used with
# ansible downstream, ensure the downstream ansible is properly 
# encapsulated. This also applies to any foreman templating 
# that may be incompatible with anisble template parsing,
# however, I think this should be rare.
